Final Project

Team 5: Thomas Shane, Paola Escamilla, Takuma Koide, Habtamu Tikuye, Mair Manson, Derrick Amegashie


Selected Topic
An Analysis of Public Bike Sharing Services to uncover growing trends for potential business expansion

Reasons for selecting Topic
We want to offer a deeper analysis to investors and community on the growth trends of Public Bike Sharing Services in order to motivate investors to expand the business and increase trust from community to their usage

Description of source data
We will be using datasources from CitiBike, BlueBikes and we are searching for census data about commutes (such as gender, age, occupation, type of using, etc)

Questions to answer
What is the growth trend in the past 10 years?

Role Definition
The team has found a natural work dynamic. We will be taking advantage of the already used channels, such as slack and zoom website.

Communication Protocol
The protocol is still in progress. However, we will rely our communication on two components (1) follow up meetings and (2) work distribution.

Provisional Model
-Visualize the map data, heat map of users, run analysis on how start location/end location of bike travel may change by the time of the day/weekday or weekend to assess the purpose of the bike rides by users.
-Visualize the trend in the usage of bike sharing that shows strong spike in certain time period, weekday vs. weekend, gender, location of bike stations, and overall change in trend/grown in users in the past 10 years to identify the how these bike sharing services are evolving in the major cities.


Audience

## Selected Topic:

An Analysis of Public Bike Sharing (PBS) Services to uncover growing trends for potential business expansion

## Reasons for selecting Topic:

We want to offer a deeper analysis to investors and community on the growth trends of Public Bike Sharing Services in order to motivate investors to expand the business and increase trust from community to their usage

## Variables to Consider:
-       Population, gender, age range
-       Weather
-       Popular / Unpopular routes
-       Weekday / Weekend comparison
-       Time of the day analysis
## Description of sources for Project:
-       CitiBike (NYC)
-       BlueBikes (Boston)
-       Healthy Ride (Pittsburgh)
-       Divvy Bikes (Chicago)
-       Climate Information: < https://developer.accuweather.com/>, < https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search>
## Questions to answers:
-       Who are the main users of PBS and why?
-       What are the important factors that cause high demand of PBS in certain city/area/time period?
-       Are there any factors that cause negative impact on the growth of PBS in city? (weather, location of bike docks, etc…)
## Role Definition
The team has found a natural work dynamic. We will be taking advantage of the already used channels, such as slack and zoom website.
## Methodology

- We will use Visualization using Tableau and R. 

## Provisional Model for Machine Learning

- Run a series of regression on correlation between the factors such as weather, seasonality, characteristics of area (office, leisure, academic, etc…) with the usage of PBS.
- Visualize the maps of each city and  show popular routes. Combine the map image with layering and pop-up highlighting the major stations, landmarks to assess the main incentives of riders choosing that routes.
